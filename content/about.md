## A West Marches Campaign

### The Pitch

Beyond the crumbling walls of **Halcyon Keep** lies The Reaches: a vast wilderness of forgotten ruins, deadly dungeons, and untold treasures. You are crawlers, fortune-seekers brave or foolish enough to venture into the **Shadowdark** where death lurks in every shadow, but so does glory. When your torches burn low and the darkness creeps in, will you press forward for treasure or retreat to fight another day?

### The Setup

This is a West Marches style campaign. That means it's an **Open Table**: drop in when you can play, with no weekly commitment required. The story is **Player-Driven**: you will decide where to explore and what dangers to face. This is a **Shared World**: Your discoveries become part of the living campaign. There are **Final Consequences**: death is permanent (and nearly inevitable), but you will always be able to create a new character.

### The Rules

We're playing **Shadowdark** - a fast, deadly, and old-school adventure RPG with:

- **Quick Character Creation**: Roll 3d6 down the line, pick a class, and you're ready to go in minutes
- **Torch Timers**: Light sources burn in real-time. When they're gone, beware! You don't have darkvision, but the monsters do
- **Loot-based Leveling**: Finding loot grants experience, slaying monsters does not
- **Rulings Over Rules**: Common sense and creativity beat rule-lawyering

### The World

**Halcyon Keep** is your base of operations, a fortified outpost on the edge of the Known Lands. Beyond its walls:

- **The Thornwood**: Dark forest filled with beastmen, ancient ruins, and worse
- **The Sunken Marches**: Treacherous swamps hiding a drowned civilization
- **The Ashlands**: Volcanic wastes where dragons once ruled
- **The Delve**: Endless tunnels that spiral down into true darkness

### The Tone

This is a **grimdark fantasy** about dungeon crawling. 

- Magic is dangerous and unpredictable
- Monsters don't fight fair
- Smart play beats good stats
- Running away is often the wisest choice
- Every treasure earned feels like a real victory
- There is more dice-rolling than role-playing

### What You Need

- **A Browser**: We use Foundry, a web-based virtual tabletop
- **Attitude**: Ready for challenge, clever thinking, and character death
- **Time**: Sessions run 2-4 hours on the scheduled time
- **Communication**: Join our Discord for scheduling a crawl

### How It Works

1. **Gather a Party**: Find 3-5 players for an expedition beyond the keep's walls
2. **Choose a Destination**: Pick rumors to investigate or known dungeons to explore
3. **Survive & Profit**: Delve into danger, grab treasure, and get out alive
4. **Share Intel**: Report discoveries to the other crawlers back at Halcyon Keep
5. **Carouse**: Throw a big party for bonus XP, and prepare for the next crawl
