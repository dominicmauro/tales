## A West Marches Campaign

### The Pitch

Beyond the crumbling walls of **Last Light Keep** lies the Shadowdark—a vast wilderness of forgotten ruins, deadly dungeons, and untold treasures. You are crawlers, fortune-seekers brave or foolish enough to venture where the light fails. Death lurks in every shadow, but so does glory. When your torches burn low and the darkness presses in, will you press forward for treasure or retreat to fight another day?

### The Setup

- **Open Table**: Drop in when you can play, no weekly commitment required
- **Player-Driven**: You decide where to explore and what dangers to face
- **Shared World**: Your discoveries become part of the living campaign
- **Real Consequences**: Death is permanent, but new heroes always arise

### The Rules

We’re using **Shadowdark RPG**—fast, deadly, and focused on old-school adventure:

- **Quick Character Creation**: Roll 3d6 down the line, pick a class, and go
- **Torch Timers**: Light sources burn in real-time—when they’re gone, you’re in trouble
- **XP for Treasure**: Gold spent = experience gained, not monster kills
- **Rulings Over Rules**: Common sense and creativity beat rule-lawyering

### The World

**Last Light Keep** is your base—a fortified outpost on the edge of the known world. Beyond its walls:

- **The Thornwood**: Dark forest filled with beastmen, ancient ruins, and worse
- **The Sunken Marches**: Treacherous swamps hiding a drowned civilization
- **The Ashlands**: Volcanic wastes where dragons once ruled
- **The Delve**: Endless tunnels that spiral down into true darkness

### The Tone

This is **gritty fantasy** where:

- Magic is dangerous and unpredictable
- Monsters don’t fight fair
- Smart play beats good stats
- Running away is often the wisest choice
- Every treasure earned feels like a real victory

### What You Need

- **Dice**: Standard D&D set (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
- **Attitude**: Ready for challenge, clever thinking, and character death
- **Time**: Sessions run 3-4 hours on [Day] at [Time] via Foundry VTT
- **Communication**: Join our [Discord/Platform] for scheduling expeditions

### How It Works

1. **Gather a Party**: 3-5 players coordinate an expedition
1. **Choose a Destination**: Pick rumors to investigate or areas to explore
1. **Survive & Profit**: Delve into danger, grab treasure, get out alive
1. **Share Intel**: Report discoveries back at Last Light Keep
1. **Spend Gold**: Carouse for XP and prepare for the next venture

### Why Play?

- **Low Commitment**: Play when your schedule allows
- **High Stakes**: Every decision matters when death is one bad roll away
- **Emergent Story**: Your actions shape the world and create the narrative
- **Pure Adventure**: Focus on exploration, problem-solving, and treasure hunting
