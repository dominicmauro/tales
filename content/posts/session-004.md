Fresh from their triumph in the Lost Citadel, **Isolde** (Darren), **Ryarn** (Trysco), and **Sariel** (Max) descended into the notorious Tomb of the Serpent Kings. What awaited them was a lesson in both cunning and the cruel randomness of fate.

## The Guard Tombs

The party began their methodical exploration in the **Guard Tombs**, identical chambers that would teach them the patterns of this ancient sepulcher. Here, Isolde's keen eyes spotted something others might miss—the statues were hollow. Learning from this discovery, when they reached the **Scholar Tomb**, wise Sariel used a 10-foot pole to smash the clay statue from a safe distance, claiming the golden amulet within without risking the poisonous trap that had been their predecessor's doom.

## The Sorcerer's Snare

In the **Sorcerer Tomb**, they contemplated stealing a silver ring worn by the clay statue there, but decided to collect it on their return journey – although not all of them would live to see that journey.

## Blood and Stone

The end of the entrance hallway provided their first taste of real danger. When the massive stone hammer swung down with crushing force, Isolde and Ryarn dove to safety, but Sariel was caught in its deadly arc. As he lay bleeding, his life ebbing away, Isolde's alchemical skills proved their worth—she crafted a curative that pulled him back from death's threshold.

## The False King's Wrath

Recuperated but wary, they entered the **False King's Tomb**. The ornate coffins told tales of serpentine genealogy and depicted an ouroboros consuming the world itself. But the dead did not rest quietly—skeletal guardians erupted from their resting places with fury born of centuries lost!

The battle was fierce but swift. Sariel's **Mage Armor** spell crackled to life with supernatural perfection, while Ryarn bore the brunt of skeletal claws. Isolde's alchemical mastery shone again with a critical success, producing double the expected healing potions. Choosing boldness over caution, they used **Burning Hands** to assault the remaining coffins. Though Ryarn took another grievous wound, Isolde's deadly longbow shot and Ryarn's blade work ended the threat.

Bloodied but victorious, they retreated to the surface to rest and plan their next move.

## Secrets Beneath the Serpent God

Returning with renewed vigor, they investigated the **False Temple**. Sariel's trained eye immediately spotted the statue's misalignment—a telltale sign of hidden passages. Sliding it aside revealed the **Secret Guardroom**, where they claimed a usable spear and a silver icon of a scowling snake king worth 50 gold pieces.

## The Oily Waters

The **Statue Hall** led them to the **Tomb Atrium**, where dark, licorice-scented water filled an ancient pit. Isolde's investigation of the mysterious pool awakened something terrible—**Mummy Claws** erupted from the depths with murderous intent! But the party's experience showed; they dispatched the undead limbs with ruthless efficiency.

## Lightning and Loss

Emboldened by their success, Sariel ventured into **Tomb of Xisor the Green**. The pressure plate beneath his feet triggered an ancient lightning bolt spell, the electrical fury slamming him unconscious against the chamber wall. Isolde, showing the courage that had kept them alive this long, rushed to his aid without checking for additional dangers. Her alchemical prowess proved miraculous—not only did she stabilize Sariel, but she created two more healing potions from her supplies.

## The Final Tragedy

But their commotion had not gone unnoticed. The noise attracted wandering skeletal guardians, and our heroes found themselves cornered in the lightning trap chamber. What followed was a desperate fight for survival.

The skeletons charged into the very trap that had felled Sariel, the lightning bolt crackling through the air—but this time, Isolde's reflexes saved her from the electrical assault. The melee that followed was brutal and chaotic. Steel rang against bone, magic flared, and blood spilled on ancient stone.

In the end, it was not enough.

Despite their courage, their cunning, and their bond forged in previous trials, Sariel fell to skeletal blades. His friends could only watch in horror as their companion—survivor of the Slime Lord's trial, conqueror of the Lost Citadel, master of arcane arts—bled his last upon the stones of the Serpent Kings.

## The Price of Glory

With heavy hearts, Isolde and Ryarn ended the final skeleton and claimed the **Electrum Disc** worth 100 gold pieces from the chamber wall. But no treasure could fill the void left by their fallen friend.

They emerged from the tomb as they had entered the Trial of the Slime Lord—fewer in number, marked by loss, but carrying the hard-won wisdom that survival in the Shadowdark comes at the highest price.

*In the depths of the earth, even the mightiest can fall to a moment's misfortune. Sariel's sacrifice stands as testament to both the glory and the terrible cost of the crawler's life.*
