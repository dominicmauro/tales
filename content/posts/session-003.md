The three survivors of the Trial of the Slime Lord—**Isolde** (Darren), **Ryarn** (Trysco), and **Sariel** (Max)—now bearing the dark boon of their ordeal, set their sights on new treasures. The Lost Citadel of the Scarlet Minotaur called to them, its ancient walls promising riches for those bold enough to claim them. Approaching from the northeast, the party discovered a shattered door leading into the depths of the ancient stronghold. 

## The Bronze Bull's Challenge

A **Bull Statue** chamber greeted them first, where a towering bronze bull statue stood poised to charge. But Isolde's nimble fingers proved swifter than the ancient trap—with a natural 20 on her Dexterity check, she pried loose the emerald from the creature's forehead, worth 120 gold pieces, and completely disarmed the deadly mechanism before anyone even knew what horrors it might have unleashed.

## The Animated Arsenal

After exploring a ransacked supply room, the party ventured into the **Training Chamber**, where their greed nearly proved their undoing. The moment they touched the weapons, three suits of animated armor sprang to life! Ryarn's quick thinking with his bolas immobilized one attacker while Sariel and Isolde retreated to the safety of the hallway. Magic missiles, handaxes, and arrows made short work of the magical guardians, but the trap reset itself, moving the armor back to their stands.

Undeterred by this setback, the party devised a clever solution. "What if we tie a rope around the sword without touching it, and pull it out of the room?" And so they did, standing safely outside while claiming their prizes—two additional swords for their growing arsenal.

## The Hall of Kings

The **Hall of Kings** presented three bronze statues of ancient rulers: Damanthus, Sarpen, and Minoros—each wearing a diadem adorned with valuable pearls. Wary of more traps, the cautious crawlers took careful notes of the royal lineage and even tied ropes around the statues in case they animated.

When Isolde first touched a diadem, the statue's great sword lashed out, dealing a glancing blow and confirming their suspicions. But wisdom born of experience led to another elegant solution—using a 10-foot pole, they knocked the diadems off from outside the statues' reach, claiming all three pearl-adorned crowns worth 40 gold pieces each. Such clever thinking earned everyone bonus experience!

## The Whispering Shadows

The final chamber they dared to explore was the **Sacrifice Cave**, where dozens of smoky, humanlike shadows flickered at the edge of their torchlight. The very air seemed to whisper with malevolent intent. Recognizing the danger, they wisely chose not to linger in that accursed place.

## Fortune Favors the Bold

Remarkably, despite the risky nature of the dungeon, the party encountered not a single random monster during their entire expedition—an incredible stroke of luck in a place where danger lurks around every corner.

## The Spoils of Victory

Their careful approach and clever tactics paid off handsomely:
- **120 GP emerald** claimed by Isolde's deft fingers
- **Three pearl diadems** worth 40 GP each (120 GP total)
- **Two additional long swords** liberated from the training chamber

## Ascension

The post-crawl celebration proved as profitable as the dungeon itself. The carouse results provided enough experience to elevate all three survivors to **Level 2**—true crawlers now, no longer the desperate zero-level villagers who once faced the Slime Lord's trial.
