**Clee Parr** (Kyle), **Isolde** (Darren), **Ryarn Aer** (Trysco), **Mirena** (Zack), and **Plum Pudding** (Cassi) returned to the Lost Citadel with determination burning bright. **Rogath** and his beastmen had fled deeper into the citadel's maze-like halls, carrying **Marasoda** with them. Without a proper map, the party would need to methodically explore uncharted sections, hoping their quarry hadn't found an exit to the world above.

**Clee** began the delve with a stirring performance, his bardic magic bolstering his own courage for the trials ahead.

## The Sorcerous Pillars

**Ryarn** led the way into a **Bull Statue** chamber, spotting the bronze guardian but finding himself too committed to retreat. **Isolde**, moving with practiced speed, leapt atop the statue to disarm its mechanism before it could activate: only to learn that this trap had been disarmed by a previous band of crawlers. **Plum** and **Mirena** confirmed a path forward to the east, deeper into unexplored territory and into the deadly **Sorcerous Pillars** chamber. **Plum** cautiously advanced with her lantern, illuminating four pairs of jewel-toned pillars capped in black marble, and beyond them, a black marble altar bearing a bronze greatsword embedded in stone.

This was **Asterion**, the legendary blade said to prevent its wielder from being moved against their will—a prize well worth the risk.

## Tactical Brilliance

While **Mirena** and **Ryarn** secured their rear by exploring the **Blood Bowls** chamber to the west, **Plum** demonstrated the versatility of her newly acquired magical arsenal. Using her **Wand of Dispel Magic**, she temporarily suppressed the red pillars' flame enchantment—removing the first of four deadly obstacles. (Attempting to dispel the magicks of the second pillar re-activated the first pillar, briefly incinerating Plum and Clee until they wisely retreated.)

Here, **Clee** contributed a stroke of dark genius. Using his **Wand of Unlife**, he reanimated the corpse of an ettercap that had died attempting this very trial. The undead "skettercap" stumbled forward through the remaining hazards—drowning in phantom seawater, succumbing to poison, and finally going blind—but its unliving form persisted long enough to wrench **Asterion** free and hurl the blade past all four pillars to safety.

**Mirena** rushed forward with rope to assist, though the skettercap's success made such precautions unnecessary. The legendary greatsword was theirs, claimed without a single living soul risking the pillars' wrath.

## The Beastman Ambush

Pushing deeper into the citadel, **Ryarn** spotted beastmen lying in wait. In a brilliant improvisation, he called out a deceptive warning: "Look out Isolde, there's only two of us!" The beastmen, fooled into thinking the party was scattered and vulnerable, rushed forward into a coordinated killing ground.

**Isolde**'s arrows flew with deadly precision while **Plum**'s spells crackled through the air. **Clee**'s bardic magic enhanced their strikes, and **Mirena** darted between shadows to strike from unexpected angles. The ambushers became the ambushed, falling swiftly to the crawlers' superior tactics.

## Blood Magic

Returning to the **Blood Bowls** chamber, the party filled three of the six terracotta vessels with fresh blood from their fallen enemies. **Clee**, ever curious about ancient magic, drank from one of the bowls and discovered the blood had transformed into potent healing magic—restoring 1d4 hit points to the drinker before the vessel crumbled to dust.

Wisely, the party decided to preserve the remaining healing bowls for when their need was more desperate. They were still fresh, still strong, and **Rogath** remained at large.

## The Ettercap Patrol

Exiting west from the **Blood Bowls** chamber, the party found themselves in a long hallway where four ettercaps prowled, clearly searching for gold and gems in the aftermath of the recent faction conflicts. The spider-creatures' purple fur bristled as they spotted the intruders, their many eyes glinting with predatory hunger.

**Ryarn** raised his shield and stepped forward to anchor the line, his axe ready to meet the first charge. **Isolde** nocked arrows with practiced efficiency, each shaft finding its mark in ettercap flesh. The creatures were tough, their chitinous bodies absorbing punishment that would have easily felled lesser foes.

**Plum** unleashed magical fury while **Mirena** used her mobility to flank the spider-creatures, her blade seeking vulnerable joints between exoskeletal plates. **Clee** maintained his bardic performance, the supernatural music bolstering his allies while deeply unsettling the ettercaps.

But the creatures were fighting in their own territory, and more ettercap reinforcements could arrive at any moment. The party's resources were being steadily drained—arrows spent, spells expended, and healing potions consumed. One ettercap fell, then another, but the remaining two proved tenacious.

Recognizing that a prolonged battle would leave them vulnerable to being trapped by additional patrols, the crawlers made the difficult call to withdraw and executed a fighting retreat. **Ryarn** shielded their withdrawal while **Isolde** fired covering shots. They disengaged before the ettercaps could coordinate a proper counterattack, fleeing back through familiar passages toward the exit.

## Treasures and Unfinished Business

The expedition yielded significant prizes—**Asterion**, the immovable greatsword, now hung on **Ryarn**'s back alongside his shield. The knowledge of the healing blood bowls' location provided a crucial resource for future delves. Their clever tactics with the skettercap and the beastman ambush demonstrated growing mastery of the citadel's challenges.

Yet **Marasoda** remained lost, **Rogath** remained free, and the beastmen's refuge remained undiscovered. The ettercaps were growing more organized in their patrols, suggesting the faction war might be turning in their favor. Time was running out—not just within each delve, but in the larger strategic picture of the citadel itself.

*The crawlers have accumulated legendary weapons and magical power, but the greatest prize continues to elude them. Somewhere in the citadel's previously-explored depths, Rogath clutches Marasoda and plots his survival. The final confrontation draws near, but first, the hunters must become the hunted, navigating increasingly hostile territory to corner their desperate prey.*
