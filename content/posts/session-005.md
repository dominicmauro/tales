## Between Adventures

After mourning the loss of their friend Sariel, our surviving crawlers spent their hard-earned gold in the taverns and gambling halls of town. The carouse proved fortuitous for all:

- **Ryarn** (Trysco) won hearts with a bawdy song mocking an unpopular local noble, earning him a loyal bard ally
- **Eliara** (Max), Sariel's replacement, demonstrated supernatural luck at knife throwing, earning divine favor in the form of a luck token
- **Isolde** (Darren) proved her cunning at the gaming tables, besting a rival crawler in the notorious game of "Wizards and Thieves"

Refreshed and reinforced, they returned to the Lost Citadel, ready to delve deeper into its mysteries.

## The Citadel's Secrets

Starting from the northern section they'd previously explored, the party ventured south into a **Bull Statue** chamber. Wisdom born of experience kept them clear of the trap's trigger, allowing them to safely examine the mechanism.

From there, they discovered the **Mysterious Bowls** chamber, where six terracotta vessels bore strange seals depicting warriors kneeling in black rain with arms and mouths open to the sky. Though intrigued by these ritual implements, they chose not to test their properties.

## Trials of Fire and Discovery

Moving north, they encountered another **Bull Statue** chamber—but Eliara and Isolde quickly realized this was the very same statue Isolde had robbed in their previous expedition. The Lost Citadel's layout was more labyrinthine than they'd imagined!

The **Sorcerous Pillars** chamber presented their greatest challenge yet. When Eliara stepped past the first pillar, her rope burst into flames, but Ryarn's quick thinking pulled her back before serious harm befell her. Here, Eliara's divine heritage proved invaluable—her **God's Blood** background revealed the pillars' true nature: a sacrificial trial designed to test worthiness before granting divine offerings.

The sight of a dead ettercap, its fur scorched and eyes clawed out by its own claws, served as a grim reminder of the trial's lethality. Salt rime coated its mouth and chest—clear signs it had been driven mad by the blue pillars' drowning effect before clawing out its own eyes to escape the purple pillars' blindness. The party wisely chose to retreat rather than attempt this deadly gauntlet.

## Fortune and Danger

Their cautious approach paid dividends in the **Robing Chamber**. Eliara, ever alert for traps, identified the emerald in the bronze bull's forehead as the arcane focus powering its deadly charge. With surgical precision, she disarmed the ancient mechanism and claimed the 120 gold piece gemstone—a princely sum indeed.

The **Blinding Cave** offered more treasures: Eliara claimed a serviceable shortsword while Isolde discovered a mysterious bronze key, its purpose yet unknown but clearly significant given its craftsmanship.

## An Unlikely Encounter

In the **Mural Chamber**, Isolde's keen eyes spotted movement—an ettercap clinging to the shadows. Rather than risk a fight, she backed away, returning with her allies. The ettercap, **Eska**, failed to sneak away from the combined crawlers, and what followed was an unlikely negotiation. Eska's eyes fixed hungrily on Isolde's emerald, and seemed particularly interested in whether the party had consumed the wrapped beastmen they'd discovered. Ryarn, ever the diplomat, offered the emerald in exchange for safe passage through ettercap territory.

## The Red Devil Arrives

But before any deal could be struck, the dungeon's most terrible resident made his presence known. The **Scarlet Minotaur**—that wine-red avatar of rage—burst into the chamber with earth-shaking bellows.

The party's tactical thinking saved their lives. Recognizing the confined space worked against the massive creature's charging attacks, they took cover behind the red pillars of the **Mural Chamber**. The minotaur's fury was devastating—its massive greataxe **Bloodlust** shattered Ryarn's shield like kindling, and its horns found flesh in a brutal goring attack. Only fortune prevented worse wounds as its final axe swing went wide.

Eska fled westward in terror while our heroes made a desperate gambit. Recognizing the southern double doors as their salvation, they threw them wide and burst into the blessed daylight beyond. The Scarlet Minotaur, for all its immortal rage, could not follow them into the sun.

## The Price of Knowledge

The party emerged battered but alive, richer in both gold and hard-won knowledge. They'd learned that:
- The Lost Citadel's trials demand blood and sacrifice for their rewards
- The ettercaps are aware of their presence and movements
- The Scarlet Minotaur's domain has limits, but within those boundaries, he is death incarnate

Most importantly, they'd added two significant treasures to their collection: a 120 gold piece emerald and a bronze key that surely unlocks secrets yet to be discovered.

*As they caught their breath in the desert sun, the surviving crawlers could hear the distant bellowing of the Scarlet Minotaur echoing through the stone halls behind them. The Lost Citadel had shown them both its treasures and its terrors—and they knew they would return to face both again.*
