# Session 14: Secrets of the Compass Rose

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Players:** Max, Trysco, Darren, Zack  
**Characters:** Fiora (Elf Rogue), Roke Ritchie (Goblin Wizard), Lenk (Goblin Witch), Mirena (Human Desert Rider)

## Into the Highlands

A fresh group of crawlers made their way through the Thornwood and into the Witchstone Highland, bound for the ruins of Bittermold Keep. During the march, Roke had a moment of magical brilliance—a critical success on a detect magic spell that would foreshadow the discoveries to come.

## Navigating the Memorial Chamber

Descending once more into the dissolving halls beneath the keep, the party moved carefully through the Entry Hall (Area 1) and into the Memorial Chamber (Area 2). Having learned from previous expeditions about the acid quicksand trap, they carefully skirted the suspiciously smooth floor where the mud abruptly ended.

The party discovered a door to the south, barricaded with detritus and iron spikes. After spending several rounds clearing the obstruction, they found—to their frustration—that it was also barricaded from the other side. Even with leverage from a 10-foot pole, the door proved impossible to force open.

## The Jagged Holes

Moving into the eastern passage, the party entered a chamber (Area 7) where the east wall was pockmarked with jagged holes at varying heights. The air carried that distinctive pre-vomit taste that experienced crawlers know means danger. Wisely, no one immediately stuck their hand into the suspicious holes.

Exploring further, they discovered Area 6, where Fiora found a fat iron key sewn into the hem of a tattered crimson banner. More importantly, she also discovered a blue pearl worth 40 gold pieces in a glass bowl filled with ashes and human teeth.

## The Skeleton Butler

When Fiora picked up the pearl, the teeth and ash knit together into a skeleton with red pinpoint lights for eyes. Lenk, drawing on memories of "Skeleton Sundays" from their time at the cult compound, rolled a natural 20 on an Intelligence check and immediately recognized this as a classic "undead butler" situation—whoever holds the pearl commands the skeleton!

The party, in a stroke of either genius or madness, decided to have the skeleton reach into one of the jagged holes. The skeleton pulled out a carved bone etched with infernal runes—a minor magical item that can burst into flame once per day for 1d4 rounds. Ancient magic from when the Bittermolds made pacts with fiendish patrons.

## The Ichor Ooze Ambush

Emboldened by success, they had the skeleton reach into another hole. This time, something pulled back—an **Ichor Ooze** burst from the wall! The rubbery, corrosive creature proved dangerous, especially to Mirena who took the brunt of its acidic attacks (10 damage total). However, the party's combined efforts—particularly Roke's well-placed *Burning Hands* spell—made short work of the ooze before it could do more damage.

## The Pearl and Obsidian Fountains

Moving west into Area 8, the party discovered two fountains: one pearl white, one obsidian black. In the pearl fountain floated a dead mutant catfish—one of those horrifying creatures with legs and arms. Mirena hauled it out for later use.

The obsidian fountain's water smelled sulfurous and made their eyes water. When Fiora experimented by mixing waters from both fountains, they discovered the liquids refused to combine, floating separately like oil and water—clearly not normal water behavior.

Roke examined the bas-relief carving on the north wall, seeing an impressionistic depiction of Bittermold Keep and a many-fingered man (8 fingers on one hand, 11 on the other) dropping a heart-shaped stone into his mouth. The walls of dissolution had distorted most details, but this image remained haunting.

## First Contact with the Howlers

Lenk used the *Shadowdance* spell to create an illusory knight, sending it ahead as a scout. When the party followed, they encountered four **Howler** guards in Area 9—the feral halflings with sharpened teeth and coyote-pelt cloaks.

The initial contact was tense. The Howlers grabbed their clubs, suspicious and hostile. But when the party offered them the dead mutant catfish, everything changed. The halflings were thrilled at the prospect of a fresh meal and instantly became friendly. "Thanks! Anything we can do for you, you let us know," they said while impaling chunks of catfish on their cudgels to roast over their campfire.

## The Magic Compass

Throughout their exploration, Mirena kept asking the skeleton for guidance. It repeatedly pointed back to the compass rose carved into the floor of Area 5. After much investigation and debate about how to activate it, Roke cast *Detect Magic* again (with help from shared luck tokens after a near-mishap) and discovered it radiated divination magic with an auditory component.

With another excellent Intelligence check (23!), the party deduced that this was no ordinary compass—it was enchanted to *find things*. They spoke aloud: "Where is Fiora's skeleton?" Radiant yellow light spun around the compass and pointed directly at their undead butler. Success!

Next question: "Where is the nearest secret door?" The compass pointed northeast, toward Area 3. Following its guidance, they discovered a hidden door leading to the **Pipe Organ Vault**.

## The Organ and the Gas Trap

In Area 3, the party found a massive pipe organ filling the east wall—swollen wood, verdigris-crusted brass tubes, carved with frolicking imps. The ceiling soared high above in a vault specifically built for this incredible instrument.

But Fiora's thief senses were tingling. Examining the ceiling, Roque spotted hundreds of pin-sized holes—a classic poison gas trap, ready to flood the room if the wrong keys were played. The party wisely decided this was a problem for another day.

## Retreat and Revelry

Having made significant discoveries and narrowly avoided multiple dangers, the party decided to head home while they were ahead. Back at Halcyon Keep, they pooled 30 gold pieces for a proper carouse:

- **Mirena** hazily remembered donating 10% of their wealth to a glib priest (or possibly to their camel named Priest). *+3 XP*
- **Lenk** survived a blindfolded knife-throwing demonstration unscathed! *+4 XP and a Luck Token*
- **Fiora** got so drunk she was locked in the stocks for three days and fined 20% of her wealth for setting a building on fire. *+2 XP*
- **Roke** led the entire tavern in a wildly insulting song about a disliked noble. *+4 XP*

**Mirena leveled up to 3rd level!** Her desert rider training pays dividends with +2 to damage and +1 to attacks—a formidable combatant in the making.

## Treasure Acquired

- Fat iron key
- Blue pearl (40 gp) - commands the skeleton butler
- Carved infernal bone (minor magic item - burns 1/day for 1d4 rounds)
- Dead mutant catfish (successfully traded to Howlers for goodwill)

## Mysteries Deepening

- What door does the fat iron key open?
- What does the pipe organ do other than being trapped?
- Where are the missing organ keys?
- Where is the many-fingered man and his heart-shaped stone?
- Can the party maintain their alliance with the Howlers or will they instead ally with the Bittermolds?

## Next Session

The party now has a powerful tool—the magic compass can help them locate secret doors, treasures, and possibly even the fabled Cloven Heart ruby. But the strange Howlers and their rivals the Bittermolds pose an obstacle to deeper exploration. And somewhere in these dissolving halls, the Dissolution of all things waits…
