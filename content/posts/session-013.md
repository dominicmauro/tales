**Clee Parr** (Kyle), **Isolde** (Darren), **Ryarn Aer** (Trysco), **Mirena** (Zack), and **Plum Pudding** (Cassi) set out north along the shore of the Wraithwater Fjord, crossing into Witchstone Highlands where they discovered the ruins of Bittermold Keep. The ancient stronghold sat upon a hill, its once-mighty stone walls melting into the bedrock like warm wax—a sure sign of something deeply wrong beneath.

Before descending into the keep's depths, the party caught wind of two intriguing rumors: the wealthy Bittermold Family had once lived here before their line suddenly died out, and the lord of Bittermold Keep was said to have possessed a magic ruby that let him walk through fire unscathed, supposedly a gift from a demon.

## The Entry Hall and Memorial Chamber

Descending through a rusty trapdoor, the party found themselves in the **Entry Hall** (Area 1), where a misshapen, waxy statue stood in an alcove. The humid, sour air pressed in around them as they examined the melted lump that had once been a life-sized statue of Sir Reginald Bittermold. Child-sized footprints in the mud led deeper into the complex.

Moving cautiously into the **Memorial Chamber** (Area 2), the party discovered dozens of stone busts carved into deep wall niches, all melting and distorted beyond recognition. It was here that Plum Pudding learned a valuable lesson about watching where you step—the unfortunate crawler stumbled directly into an acid quicksand trap, the smooth floor giving way beneath her feet!

Plum lucky danced free from the deadly trap before being devoured and dissolved, Mirena noticed something odd about one of the busts: a stone jammed in its mouth. Ever curious, she pried it free. The bust immediately began bellowing a jaunty anthem—the song of the Bittermold Family!

**THE BALLAD OF BITTERMOLD KEEP**
(To be sung loudly and with excessive pride)

Oh, gather 'round and raise your cup,  
For Bittermold blood, we lift it up!  
From stone and hall and hearth so bright,  
We held this keep through day and night!

**CHORUS:**  
Bittermold! Bittermold! Stalwart and true!  
With seven-fingered hands, we prosper and grew!  
Our ruby heart burns fierce and bold,  
Forever shall reign the House of Bittermold!

Sir Reginald, brave and strong,  
Led our line for ages long,  
Fair Rosemary, gentle and wise,  
Saw all our foes to their demise!

**CHORUS:**  
Bittermold! Bittermold! Stalwart and true!  
With seven-fingered hands, we prosper and grew!  
Our ruby heart burns fierce and bold,  
Forever shall reign the House of Bittermold!

From mountain high to valley low,  
Our banner waves where e'er we go!  
No curse nor demon, foe nor blight,  
Can dim the Bittermold's sacred light!

**FINAL CHORUS:**  
BITTERMOLD! BITTERMOLD! STALWART AND TRUE!  
WITH SEVEN-FINGERED HANDS, WE PROSPER AND GREW!  
OUR RUBY HEART BURNS FIERCE AND BOLD,  
FOREVER SHALL REIGN THE HOUSE OF BITTERMOLD!

Long may we prosper! Long may we stand!  
The greatest house in all the land!

## The Dagger and the Howlers

The party found a narrow passage leading to another chamber with an elaborate compass rose carved into the floor, where Ryarn's curiosity got the better of him. Examining a mysterious dagger, Ryarn was engulfed in arcane fire and miraculously took a single point damage from the cursed blade *Wrath Bolt*. 

But their real troubles were just beginning. The singing bust in the Memorial Chamber had done its job too well—within a round, three **Howlers** (the barbaric halflings who now claimed parts of the keep) burst into the room and ambushed Mirena!

The party cut down the attackers swiftly, but one escaped deeper into the complex, its ululating war cry echoing through the dissolving halls. The crawlers knew what that meant: reinforcements.

## The Battle of the Memorial Chamber

Nine more Howlers poured out from their camp (Area 4), ready for battle! What followed was a furious melee in the cramped Memorial Chamber. The Howlers fought with savage ferocity, but they hadn't counted on Clee Parr's necromantic prowess. The bard summoned forth a small army of wraiths that swarmed the halfling warriors, spectral hands tearing and rending.

When the dust settled and the last wraith dissipated, only one Howler remained: Gordock Breeg himself, the warchief, cut off from escape. Recognizing the hopelessness of his situation, Gordock wisely surrendered.

## An Unexpected Alliance

What the party learned from Gordock changed everything. The halfling warchief spoke of **Mugdulblub**—the primordial ooze that bubbled up from below, driving the original Bittermold family to madness. He explained that he and his Howlers were locked in a vicious war with the Bittermolds (the warped descendants of the keep's former residents).

Gordock offered them a prize—algae from the pools near Mugdulblub's hall—and made a desperate request: kill the Bittermolds. In exchange, he would end his attacks on nearby surface settlements.

The party agreed to consider his proposal and prepared to leave the dissolving halls.

## A Mysterious Locket

Back at Halcyon Keep, Clee attempted to track down the red-haired woman depicted in the silver locket recovered from the body of a dead adventurer in the Lost Citadel. Clee's investigation found this woman had been recently kidnapped by the **Cult of the Crimson Hand**, whose evil temple is carved into the side of a mountain.

A new quest beckoned, and darker mysteries awaited.

---

*The crawlers have begun exploring the Southern Reaches for new dungeons and new treasures. If they return to Bittermold Keep, they must decide whether to honor their tentative agreement with Gordock and hunt the Bittermolds. If they do not, where will the find the Cult of the Crimson Hand?*
