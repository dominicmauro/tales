A new band of crawlers assembled at **Halcyon Keep** with a grim purpose: to recover the bodies of **Yuri** and **Ithior**, fallen heroes who had died fighting alongside **Isolde** in the battle against the **Scarlet Minotaur**. The expedition consisted of **Plum** (Cassi), a halfling wizard; **Isolde** (Darren), the sole survivor of the previous crawl; **Clee Parr** (Kyle), a human bard; **Fiora** (Max), an elf thief; and **Ryarn Aer** (Trysco), a human fighter.

## Return to the Scene

Entering through the southern doors of the **Mural Chamber**, the party chose to head west based on **Isolde**'s recollections of the previous crawlers' route. In the **Jar Storage** chamber, they wisely avoided the explosive terracotta vessels that had claimed other unwary explorers.

The **Offering Bowls** chamber brought their first tense encounter—ettercaps who viewed their presence with suspicion. Fortunately, **Isolde**'s diplomatic efforts kept the situation from turning violent, though the spider-creatures remained wary of these new intruders.

## The Silent Courtyard

The **Central Courtyard** presented a haunting sight. The **Scarlet Minotaur** lay propped against the base of the massive black onyx bull statue, his wine-red form motionless yet unnaturally preserved—neither moving nor decomposing. The immortal avatar of rage appeared to exist in some liminal state between life and death.

**Fiora** approached **Yuri**'s corpse with professional efficiency, searching for the legendary **Marasoda, the Sludge Slayer**. But the weapon was nowhere to be found—the fallen crawler's possessions had been picked over. Where had the mighty warhammer gone?

## Dark Necromancy

**Clee Parr** made a decision that would have horrified the original builders of the citadel. Using his **Wand of Animate Dead**, he raised the **Scarlet Minotaur**'s corpse as a shambling zombie—turning the former terror of the halls into a grotesque pack mule to carry the bodies of the fallen.

Meanwhile, **Plum** conducted a macabre archaeological study of the onyx bull statue's grisly decorations. Her examination revealed the skull demographics: mostly beastmen with a handful of adventurers mixed in. She began the disturbing work of removing skulls from the ancient monument.

**Isolde**, ever practical, brewed a stimulant that sharpened her senses against ambush for the trials ahead.

## Into the Depths

With their undead porter shambling behind them carrying **Yuri** and **Ithior**'s bodies, the party moved northeast to the locked door of **The Prison**. **Fiora**'s skilled fingers made quick work of the lock, revealing the skeletal guardians within. These undead proved no match for experienced crawlers—they were destroyed almost effortlessly, yielding 15 gold pieces for their trouble.

A thorough search of **The Prison** revealed no hidden passages or treasures, so they pressed on to **The Armory**.

## Beastman Ambush

The defiling of the sacred bull statue and the desecration of the **Scarlet Minotaur**'s corpse had not gone unnoticed. Beastmen warriors, who had been watching from the shadows, launched their attack as the party entered **The Armory**. Their rage was righteous but their skills were no match for seasoned crawlers.

**Fiora** attempted to weaponize the **Bull Statue** trap in the adjacent chamber, but the beastmen fell to conventional warfare before such elaborate tactics proved necessary. Minor loot was claimed from their bodies before the party made their exit.

## The Missing Treasure

The mission succeeded in its primary objective—both **Yuri** and **Ithior**'s bodies were recovered and could be given proper burial. However, the legendary **Marasoda** remained unaccounted for. Had it been claimed by scavengers? Hidden by the dying **Yuri**? Or does it lie somewhere deeper in the citadel's unexplored chambers?

## Celebrations and Consequences

Back at **Halcyon Keep**, the successful recovery mission was celebrated with characteristic crawler excess. **Ryarn** started a tavern-wide brawl that became the stuff of legend. **Plum** defeated a noble in a high-stakes drinking contest, winning a debt owed by the mysterious **Lady Angelcake**. **Fiora** survived a blindfolded knife-throwing demonstration without a scratch, much to the crowd's amazement.

The bodies of **Yuri** and **Ithior** had been recovered and their souls could rest in peace. But the mystery of **Marasoda**'s disappearance lingered, along with the disturbing sight of the **Scarlet Minotaur**'s preserved corpse. Had they truly killed the immortal beast, or had they merely defeated one manifestation of something far more ancient and terrible?

*The recovery mission proved that even in death, crawlers look after their own. But in the depths of the Lost Citadel, the greatest treasures remain hidden, waiting for those bold enough to claim them.*
