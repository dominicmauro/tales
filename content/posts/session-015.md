Four brave crawlers: Isolde (Dwarf Ranger), Clee Parr (Human Bard), Plum Pudding (Halfling Wizard), and Fiora (Elf Thief) returned to the Hideous Halls beneath Bittermold Keep, armed with knowledge from previous expeditions of the magical compass that could find anything. What they didn't know was that this session would bring them face-to-face with an elder god

The party gathered in the Entry Hall, carefully avoiding the acid quicksand trap in the Memorial Chamber. They made a beeline toward the compass rose chamber, and **Isolde** asked it the fateful question: "Where is the most valuable treasure in this dungeon?"

The compass pointed west-southwest, deeper into unexplored territory.

**Isolde** asked a second question: "Where is the most dangerous monster in this dungeon?"

The compass pointed in almost the exact same direction.

The party exchanged meaningful glances. The most valuable treasure and the most dangerous monster were in the same place. Of course they were.

## Preparing for the Descent

**Clee** summoned wraiths to scout ahead, successfully calling forth two spectral servants. One cleared the barricaded southern door from the Compass Rose Hall, revealing stairs descending 25 feet into natural caverns. 

**Isolde** began brewing stimulants: powerful cave drugs that would keep herself alert. Meanwhile, **Plum** met the Howler guards in Area 9 again. "Have you found any Bittermolds yet?" they asked eagerly. "When we do, we will kill them," Plum assured them, maintaining the fragile alliance.

## Beneath the Ruins Beneath Bittermold

Descending into the Central Cavern, the party entered a cave network where sheets of dripping flowstone covered the walls like slow-motion granite waterfalls. A sluggish, murky river wound its way from east to west. The oppressive atmosphere of dissolution was even stronger here—the very bedrock was melting.

**Plum**, ever curious, licked one of the flow-stone pillars. It had the consistency of a thick milkshake made from countertops—stone slurry oozing down in an unnatural geological process. Nothing magical happened, but Plum lived her dream of forbidden milkshake.

**Clee**'s wraith discovered something significant to the west: an enormous chamber with a starry, swirling pool on the floor. The scouts pressed on while the party navigated the natural caverns.

But **Fiora**'s lantern illuminated a horrifying sight: gaunt, skeletal figures with pale, wet skin—the Bittermolds, descendants of the original keep's noble family. Two scuttled forward on their knuckles, hunched and curious.

"What are you doing here in our home?" one demanded, raising an arm that wobbled like a pool noodle with bones no longer quite made of bone.

**Clee**, thinking quickly, invoked the names of Reginald Bittermold and Mugdulblub. The Bittermolds startled at the name of their ancestor. "Are you also here to seek the dissolution?" they asked, dozens more emerging from the darkness.

"Yes," **Clee** lied smoothly. "We are devotees of the dissolution."

## The Catfish Alliance

While **Clee** negotiated with the Bittermolds, **Plum** wandered East into and met the mutant catfish. The talking fish with arms and legs were tragic figures transformed by Mugdulblub's influence and caught in the crossfire of faction war.

"The Bittermolds and the Howlers keep sacrificing us to Mugdulblub," one complained. "If they want to worship some evil god, they should dissolve themselves, not us!"

**Plum** was horrified by their plight and promised to help make them safe. The catfish were not monsters but sentient beings who deserved to enjoy having hands and feet.

## The March to Mugdulblub

The Bittermolds, believing the party were fellow worshippers, eagerly offered to lead them to Mugdulblub's hall. As the strange procession passed through a cave with a Tooth Pillar (hundreds of teeth driven into rubbery stone), they encountered two more Bittermolds dragging a captured Howler to be sacrificed.

The party arrived at the Hall of Mugdulblub, which **Clee'**s wraith had already scouted: a cavernous room with pockmarked walls and a starry, purple pool that swirled and trembled on the floor.

## Meeting an Elder God

As **Clee** entered the hall, an ancient, unfathomably ancient voice echoed inside his skull:

*"What has it brought to be dissolved?"*

**Clee** thought back: *"It has brought the faithful, has brought a feast. Something new."*

*"Something new?"* The voice was intrigued. *"So bored of stone and refuse and catfish.*"

Then **Isolde** examined the pool more closely. An enormous 5-foot-wide eyeball blinked open and fixed on her. Then a second "eye" opened—10 feet wide, but filled with inky darkness and lined with razor-sharp fangs. Not an eye at all. A mouth.

**Mugdulblub** had awakened.

## Clee's Gambit

The primordial ooze extended dozens of tendrils, pulling itself partially from the pool. *"Where is this sacrifice?"* it demanded.

**Clee** activated his plan: he used his bardic magic to Fascinate the Bittermolds, transfixing them with song. His wraiths began shoving the entranced cultists toward Mugdulblub.

The elder god eagerly devoured the first few Bittermolds, along with the captured Howler. But after consuming several of them, Mugdulblub's disappointment was telepathically clear:

*"This is not special. This is not new. I have devoured dozens of Bittermold spawn over the decades. I tire of something this old."*

## The God Strikes Back

Mugdulblub turned its attention to **Clee**'s wraith. It ripped chunks of spectral necrotic energy off the summoned creature and crammed them into its maw.

*"This is not even an actual bound soul. This is but summoned. Disgusting. I want MORE."*

Then Mugdulblub attacked **Clee** himself, using eldritch magic lost to time to melt the bard's bones from the inside out. **Clee** took 2 CON damage as some of his more important bones began to turn to mush.

It was time to run.

## The Great Escape

The party fled in different directions:

- **Clee** maintained his Fascinate spell while retreating, using the entranced Bittermolds as a living shield and keeping Mugdulblub fed
- **Plum** ran West and stepped into an acid quicksand trap in a prison cell with Jellified Remains, but stepped back just in time until one of Clee's wraiths *threw Plum across the quicksand gap* to safety
- **Isolde** and **Fiora** scouted ahead, though their lantern burned out at the worst possible moment, plunging her into darkness

## Plum's Philosophy Lesson

Stumbling upon another prison chamber, **Plum** encountered four Bittermolds torturing two imprisoned Howlers. Drawing on her experience with the sympathetic catfish, Plum tried a different approach:

"Have you ever considered that willing sacrifices might taste better?" she argued. "Mugdulblub wants fresh and new. Maybe willing sacrifices are new. Who likes food that struggles?"

The Bittermolds looked very confused by this theological argument, and almost immediately fell to arguing among themselves. **Plum** bought precious seconds with religious debate before sprinting through to rejoin her companions.

## Into Unknown Territory

The party regrouped in a mysterious room with a carpet of tiny mushrooms and a wall that churns and froths with bubbles. With a horde of shrieking Bittermolds in pursuit behind them, they couldn't go back the way they came—the only option was forward into unexplored territory.

**Fiora** checked for traps in the chamber ahead. The floor was safe, but the northeastern wall was hissing and popping like a boiling cauldron. The dissolution was accelerating here.

Peeking into a chamber to the East, they saw a floating alabaster statue of a woman with white eyes and a gentle expression. The floor was perfectly clean—no bones, no debris, no dust. Nothing.

Not a moment too soon, the crawlers realized the truth: the statue was floating inside an enormous Gelatinous Cube! The clean floor suddenly made sense—the cube had dissolved everything else in the room.

## Cliffhanger

With the gelatinous cube blocking any escape to the East, and Bittermolds closing in from the South, the party had only one option: head North into completely unexplored territory.

And that's where we left our heroes—trapped between an elder god, his fanatic worshippers, and an acidic transparent predator, fleeing desperately into the unknown depths of the Hideous Halls...

*The Hideous Halls have never felt more aptly named. Four crawlers face their greatest challenge yet: escaping alive from the domain of an elder god. Will they make it out? Or will they join the thousands of teeth driven into the Tooth Pillar?*

*Find out next week...*
