## New Victims, Ancient Trial

A fresh group of unfortunate villagers found themselves cast into the depths by the cultists of Mugdulblub: **Karina** (Darren), **Yuri** (Kyle), **Jasper** (Trysco), and **Denton** (Zack). Armed with nothing but their wits and the tattered clothes on their backs, they faced the same deadly gauntlet that had claimed so many before them.

## Scavenging in the Dark

**The Pit** offered its usual meager comforts—a single torch and a cryptic note left by previous victims. The desperate search for supplies began immediately.

In **The Collection** room, fortune smiled modestly upon them. Yuri claimed iron spikes and a shovel from the refuse, while Jasper discovered a shortbow with a precious handful of arrows. Karina and Denton's search yielded less useful finds—torn socks and mismatched cloth scraps, testament to those who came before. In a gesture that would prove prophetic, Yuri shared his starting dagger with Jasper, ensuring everyone had at least some means of defense.

## The Deadly Dig

**The Fetid Pool** called to them with its promise of hidden treasures beneath the muck and detritus. The backbreaking work of digging began in earnest. Denton unearthed an empty bottle, Karina found a crude club, and others discovered more bottles—small treasures in their desperate circumstances.

But the ancient tunnels were treacherous. Just as they were making progress, the ceiling gave way in a thunderous cave-in. Only Denton's supernatural luck, burning a precious luck token, saved him from being crushed. Worse still, all their hard work was undone, the passage blocked until the villagers redoubled their efforts to clear the way.

## The Slime Eaters' Domain

With no more surprisees, they pressed on to encounter **The Slime Eaters**—those grotesque centipede-like creatures that paid the villagers no mind, focused as they were on their grisly feast. Here, Yuri's bold investigation of a fallen adventurer's corpse yielded valuable prizes: a piece of hardened yellow ooze, an extra torch, and most intriguingly, a scrap of paper speaking of a legendary weapon hidden somewhere in these cursed halls.

## The Orange Madness

**The Consumption Chamber** presented both revelation and catastrophe. While most of the party examined the mysterious murals, Yuri peered ahead into **The Altar** chamber, glimpsing the skeletal guardians within. His quick thinking—barricading the door with an iron spike—likely saved their lives. As a wandering jellied skeleton approached, **Jasper** charged the first undead monstrosity with blade in hand, landing a telling blow before the creature's retaliatory strike ended his brief but valiant life. As the rest of the villagers rallied to conquer the monster, the orange slime proved irresistible to the desperate villagers. What followed was a sequence of events both tragic and absurd:

**Malchor** (Jasper's replacement after the first character fell) consumed the hallucinogenic substance and experienced enlightenment—gaining permanent wisdom as reality melted around him in beautiful, terrifying visions.

**Yuri** partook but could not maintain his sanity, suffering permanent mental damage as the psychedelic horrors overwhelmed his mind.

**Karina** consumed the slime and fled screaming in terror, haunted by visions of herself transforming into an elf—a fate more terrifying to a dwarf than death itself.

## Blood and Cleverness

Karina's screams attracted wandering jellied skeletons, but the party was ready. Denton opened with a devastating critical hit, Yuri wielded his shovel like a weapon of war, and the skeletons were destroyed before they could strike back.

But the masterstroke came in dealing with **The Altar**'s guardians. Using the slain jellied skeleton as bait, they lured **The Slime Eaters** toward **The Consumption Chamber**. With rope and cunning, they positioned the undead corpse near **The Altar** door, then threw it wide. Malchor, still hallucinating but brave, drew the skeletal guardians' attention while the slime eaters surged forward to devour them—bone, magic, and malice alike.

## The Price of Progress

As they prepared to delve deeper, the survivors had learned hard lessons about the dungeon's nature. They'd witnessed both the transformative power and terrible cost of the orange slime, used the dungeon's own monsters against each other, and claimed their first significant prize—a **bastard sword with an onyx inlay** from the defeated skeletons.

But Jasper's death served as a stark reminder: in the Trial of the Slime Lord, courage without wisdom leads only to an early grave.
