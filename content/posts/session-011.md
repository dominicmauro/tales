Five seasoned crawlers—**Plum** (Cassi), **Isolde** (Darren), **Clee** (Kyle), **Ryarn** (Trysco), and **Mirena** (Zack)—ventured once more into the Lost Citadel. The **Scarlet Minotaur** has been slain weeks ago, yet the legendary **Marasoda** remained frustratingly elusive. This expedition would finally reveal its location, though claiming it would prove another matter entirely.

## Discovery and Diplomacy

Navigating the twisting **Labyrinth**, the party emerged into the **Bas-Relief Hall**, where ancient carvings depicted acrobats leaping over charging bulls and warriors in ritualistic combat. **Mirena**'s keen ears caught the sound of chittering beastman voices beyond the walls.

**Isolde**'s methodical search revealed what others had missed—a hidden door leading directly into the **Beastmen Lair**. She threw it open to find herself face-to-face with a nest of grey-furred, feral creatures who made their squalid camp in the citadel's depths.

A tense standoff followed, weapons drawn on both sides. But **Clee Parr**'s silver tongue worked its magic once again, de-escalating the confrontation before blood could be spilled. The party withdrew, leaving the beastmen wary but unbloodied.

## The Living Floor

The **Mosaic Room**'s beautiful swirling tiles of orange, yellow, and red concealed a deadly secret. **Mirena** discovered this the hard way when she stepped upon what appeared to be part of the decorative pattern—only to find herself standing on a mottled ochre jelly.

Her instinctive stab caused the creature to split in two, multiplying the threat. **Isolde** and **Plum** moved quickly to support her, and together they dispatched both gelatinous predators before they could cause serious harm. **Mirena**'s quick reflexes and her companions' swift action prevented what could have been a fatal encounter.

## The Throne's Treasures

**Isolde**'s bronze key from earlier expeditions finally found its purpose, unlocking the door to the **Throne Room**. The chamber of red stone, gold, and mirrors held magnificent prizes:

- **Vigilant**, a golden spear that prevents its wielder from being surprised
- A pearl-adorned diadem worth a small fortune
- The throne itself—250 gold pieces worth of craftsmanship, requiring three people to carry
- A **Scroll of Burning Hands** for their growing magical arsenal

**Ryarn** and **Plum** worked together to claim the throne, while **Clee** carefully catalogued the magical items. The expedition seemed on the verge of success.

## Chaos Unleashed

Returning through the **Mosaic Room** to the **Bas-Relief Hall**, they stumbled into the eternal conflict between the citadel's factions. Three ettercaps were tearing into a lone beastman warrior, the spider-creatures' mandibles clicking with predatory hunger.

**Clee** made a fateful decision. Drawing his **Wand of Unlife**, he summoned a pair of wraiths—manifestations of death itself—and commanded them to attack the ettercaps. The supernatural entities descended upon the spider-creatures with terrible efficiency.

The beastman, saved from certain death, fled through the secret door into his lair—unwittingly triggering a chain reaction of violence.

## The Battle Erupts

The beastmen poured from their hidden chambers, **Rogath** at their head. And there, in the chieftain's hands, gleamed the unmistakable form of **Marasoda, the Sludge Slayer**—the legendary warhammer they had sought for so long!

The wraiths proved devastatingly effective. Without magic weapons, the beastmen were helpless against the incorporeal horrors. **Ryarn** held the line with sword and shield, cutting down fleeing beastmen with practiced strikes. **Isolde**'s arrows found their marks with deadly precision, each shaft dropping a grey-furred warrior. **Plum**'s spells crackled through the air, while **Mirena** darted through the melee, her blade finding gaps in beastman defenses.

Only **Rogath**, wielding **Marasoda** with desperate fury, could harm the wraiths. But even a legendary weapon in capable hands couldn't turn the tide against overwhelming supernatural force.

## The Bitter Retreat

Recognizing their hopeless position, **Rogath** ordered a retreat deeper into the citadel. The beastmen fled in disarray, leaving several of their number dead or dying. The crawlers pursued, eager to claim **Marasoda**, but the labyrinthine passages swallowed their quarry.

Time ran against them—wraiths don't last forever, and the citadel's twisting halls favored those who knew them best. The beastmen melted into the darkness, **Rogath** and **Marasoda** vanishing with them.

## Treasures and Frustration

The party emerged with significant prizes—**Vigilant**, the diadem, the throne, and valuable experience. Their coordinated tactics and magical resources had dominated the battlefield. Yet the primary objective remained tantalizingly out of reach.

**Marasoda** was found, but not claimed. **Rogath** knew they were coming for it now. The next confrontation would be on his terms, in the deep places where the beastmen had prepared defenses and ambushes.

The crawlers had proven they could defeat the citadel's defenders. Now they needed to prove they could corner a desperate chieftain who knew every secret passage, every hidden bolt-hole, every advantage the ancient fortress could provide.

## Carousing and Fortune

Back at **Halcyon Keep**, both **Ryarn** and **Clee** struck upon extraordinary luck during their celebrations. Each acquired a magic wand capable of casting third-tier spells—powerful artifacts that would prove invaluable in the final confrontation to come.

The stage was set. **Marasoda** was within reach. The beastmen were scattered but not broken. And the crawlers, now armed with legendary treasures and growing magical power, prepared for what would surely be the final delve into the Lost Citadel's depths.

*Sometimes the greatest treasures are found mere moments before being lost again. The hunt for Marasoda has become personal—not just a quest for a legendary weapon, but a test of will between cunning crawlers and a desperate chieftain who knows his world is ending.*
