Following their previous escape from the jellied skeletons, our surviving villagers—**Karina** (Darren), **Yuri** (Kyle), **Korv** (Max), and **Ithior** (Cassi)—found themselves face to face with one of the dungeon’s strangest residents.

When Korv’s attempts to force open the locked door in **The Alter** room attracted unwanted attention, fate delivered not skeletal death but something far more unpredictable: **The Collector** himself. This demented halfling, driven mad by years in the depths, proved surprisingly reasonable when Yuri’s diplomatic efforts shifted his mood from hostile to neutral.

The bargain struck was simple: the onyx-hilted bastard sword they’d claimed from the jellied skeletal guardians in exchange for the keys needed to work the alter’s mechanism. **The Collector** even agreed to guide the villagers to the final key’s location.

## Treasures of the Lost

**The Collector** led them through the dungeon’s hidden paths, first to **The Drop**, where **Tamra** (Cassi’s first character) looted a fallen adventurer’s corpse. Among the grim remains, she discovered a **Holy Symbol of Madeera**, an oil flask, and precious rope—tools that would soon prove vital.

The villagers pressed onward to the **Bronze Double Doors** leading out of the dungeon. There, they discovered that the passphrase needed to open the doors had been etched into the stone floors; but after years of foot traffic, all but the first few letters of each line had been worn away. The villagers would need to seek the first half of the passphrase deeper in the dungeon. The bronze doors loomed massive and bronze, decorated with horrific reliefs of cultists being devoured and dissolved by ooze.

## The Western Halls

**The Collector**’s guidance proved invaluable as he led them into the western sections of the dungeon. In **The Statues** chamber, the three grotesque monuments depicting the stages of slime-related trauma served as grim prophecy. From **The Drain**, Korv retrieved a tarnished brass key that would unlock future secrets.

But **The Pool** nearly claimed their first life when the translucent ooze attacked. **Tamra** attempted to turn the creature with her **Holy Symbol of Madeera**, but her neutral alignment rendered the sacred artifact powerless. In a moment of clear thinking, she passed the symbol to **Karina**—recognizing the dwarf’s lawful nature from her earlier thoughts of robbing **The Collector** (which she ultimately refrained from).

## Death in The Dripping Caves

**The Dripping Caves** lived up to their deadly reputation. As the party carefully navigated the acid-dropping stalactites, **Tamra** fell victim to the corrosive drips that had claimed so many before her. **Ithior** stepped forward as her replacement, inheriting both her gear and the grim determination to escape this death trap.

From the corpse of a long-dead miner, they claimed additional supplies: bottles, a **Scroll of Burning Hands**, and most crucially, the final hardened ooze key needed for the altar’s mechanism.

## The Ultimate Offering

**The Offering Chamber** demanded three sacrifices to reveal the first half of the passphrase to the bronze double doors: flesh, bone, and “all.” **Tamra**‘s fresh corpse provided the first two offerings, but the third required a living being. The party’s eyes turned to their guide.

In a moment of cold pragmatism, **Yuri** executed **The Collector** with a wrestling move worthy of legend—suplexing the mad halfling directly into the bubbling acid pool. The chamber accepted this ultimate sacrifice, draining to reveal the words: *“O Slime Lord, open the way before us; Dissolve us in thine glutinous glory.”*

## The Final Keys

With the complete incantation and all three hardened ooze keys, they returned to **The Alter**. Placing the yellow, black, and gray ooze pieces onto their corresponding sections of the tri-colored altar, they watched as the ancient locks melted away and activated a secret door elsewhere in the dungeon. Using the brass key from **The Drain**, **Korv** unlocked **The Armory**, claiming the magical **Trusty Helm** and additional weapons, as well as a tattered chain shirt.

A distant glow from the direction of **The Double Doors** caught the villagers’ attention—**Marasoda, the Sludge Slayer** hung suspended in a cube of deadly acid. **Yuri**’s clever use of a grappling hook allowed him to retrieve this legendary weapon, though the hook was dissolved in the process. The indestructible magic warhammer, carved with intricate geometric patterns, was the legendary weapon mentioned in the scrap of paper the villagers discovered earlier.

## The Final Confrontation

Speaking the complete passphrase at **The Double Doors**, the massive bronze doors began to open agonizingly slowly. Triggering the doors awakened the dungeon’s ultimate guardian: **Raka Ooku**, the necrotic gelatinous cube.

The battle was swift and brutal. **Korv**, the only armored villager, bravely stepped forward to engage the monstrosity but was instantly engulfed and slain. **Ithior**’s shortbow found its mark, but it was **Yuri** wielding **Marasoda** who delivered the devastating killing blow with the force of a meteorite crashing through a jello salad. Raka Ooku exploded into harmless puddles, the survivors gathered **Korv**’s undissolved equipment and weapons. Three villagers who had entered as desperate prisoners now emerged as hardened crawlers, bearing the **Boon of the Slime Lord** and legendary artifacts as proof of their trial.

**Karina**, **Yuri**, and **Ithior** stepped from the darkness into daylight, forever changed by their ordeal, carrying **Marasoda the Sludge Slayer**, the **Trusty Helm**, and the **Holy Symbol of Madeera**—treasures won through cunning, sacrifice, and desperate courage.

*The Trial of the Slime Lord had claimed many lives, but those who survived carried with them not just treasure, but the hard-won knowledge that in the depths of the earth, survival demands both wisdom and the willingness to make terrible choices.*
