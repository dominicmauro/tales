**Clee Parr** (Kyle), **Fiora** (Max), **Ryarn Aer** (Trysco), and **Plum** (Cassi) returned to the Lost Citadel with unfinished business. The legendary **Marasoda** remained missing, and the citadel's unexplored chambers still promised both treasure and peril.

## New Discoveries

Their methodical exploration led them to the **Broken Bull Statue** chamber for the first time. Here, **Fiora** claimed a shattered emerald worth 20 gold pieces while **Clee** recovered a silver locket containing a painting of a red-haired woman. The chamber told its own grim story—a young adventurer in chainmail and helm, crushed between the bronze bull's head and the cracked wall, testament to the statue's deadly charge.

In the **Offering Bowls** chamber, they made offerings of gold, a bastard sword, and the recovered locket to the ancient bowls. The old magic responded, granting them a luck token—divine favor that would prove crucial in the trials ahead.

The citadel's malevolent nature manifested in an unexpected way when a sudden gust of wind extinguished both **Ryarn**'s freshly lit torch and **Fiora**'s lantern. For two terrifying rounds, the party fumbled in absolute darkness, desperately trying to relight their sources while imagining horrors creeping closer through the black.

## Treasures of the Dead

Venturing west into the **Labyrinth**, they discovered the winding passages held their own grim treasures. In several dead-end halls, ancient terracotta jars contained handfuls of ash, a few gold coins, and thumb-sized dolls made of colorful thread—remnants of lives long extinguished.

**Clee** was the first to smash open a jar and claim its contents. From six jars they gathered about 15 gold pieces, though **Ryarn** seems to have triggered some mysterious supernatural effect whose consequences remain unknown. The party noticed the labyrinth contained an exit to the outside world, but their quest for treasure compelled them to continue exploring rather than flee to safety.

## The Faction War Erupts

The Lost Citadel's simmering conflict between ettercaps and beastmen exploded into violence as the two factions clashed at the labyrinth's edge. The crawlers cautiously advanced toward the conflict, but this chaos was merely the prelude to their own peril.

A second ettercap emerged from the shadows at the rear of the party behind **Plum**, perhaps coming to their spider-kin's aid or just searching for loot in the aftermath of battle. Their reaction to rounding the corner and encountering four crawlers was hostile, and **Fiora** was faced with a tough call: strike first and escalate the confrontation, or hope the hostile ettercap would decide not to attack.

## Ambush in the Depths

What followed was every crawler's nightmare—a pincer attack as not one but three ettercaps rounded the corner behind them. **Plum** bore the worst of the initial assault, taking both a vicious bite and being hit by poisonous web that left her unconscious and vulnerable.

The battle became a desperate struggle to protect their fallen comrade while potentially fighting on two fronts. **Fiora** stabilized **Plum** before returning to the fight with her bow, while **Ryarn** held the line with sword and shield against overwhelming odds.

## The Bard's Gambit

Recognizing their losing position, **Clee Parr** employed his bardic **Fascinate** ability in a moment of tactical brilliance. The supernatural music dazed all combatants, creating precious breathing room for **Ryarn** and **Fiora** to eliminate two of the flanking ettercaps.

## Flight Through the Maze

With the odds slightly more manageable but still dire, **Clee** scooped up the unconscious **Plum** and spun past the remaining ettercap in a daring maneuver. **Ryarn** and **Fiora** followed his lead, and the party fled desperately through the twisting passages of the **Labyrinth**.

They burst from the citadel into the harsh scrubland beyond, alive but empty-handed. The magical treasures they sought—**Marasoda** chief among them—remained lost in the citadel's depths.

## The Price of Survival

The expedition proved that even experienced crawlers face mortal peril in the Lost Citadel. Though they escaped with their lives and modest treasures, the greater prizes remained elusive. The ettercaps had shown their cunning and coordination, the beastmen continued their ancient feud, and somewhere in those stone halls, the legendary **Marasoda** waited for someone bold enough—or foolish enough—to claim it.

**Plum**'s near-death experience served as a stark reminder that in the depths of the earth, a single misstep can mean the difference between treasure and tomb.

*The Lost Citadel continues to claim its toll on those who dare its halls. Each expedition teaches hard lessons about the balance between greed and survival, between courage and recklessness. The greatest treasures demand the greatest risks—but not all who pay that price live to enjoy their rewards.*
