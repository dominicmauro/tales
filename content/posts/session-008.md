Four crawlers—**Ithior** (Cassi), **Isolde** (Darren), **Yuri** (Kyle), and **Nork** (Zack)—returned to the Lost Citadel armed with hard-won experience and the legendary weapon **Marasoda, the Sludge Slayer**. What awaited them was their greatest trial yet: a confrontation with the immortal avatar of rage itself.

Beginning their methodical exploration in the **Mural Chamber**, **Yuri** discovered a silver-inlaid bull horn hidden in a niche built into one of the vibrant murals—worth both coin and experience for his keen observation.

The **Jar Storage** chamber presented an obvious danger that **Isolde** wisely chose to avoid. When **Yuri** investigated one of the terracotta vessels, he found only sticky black mush—confirming their suspicions about the explosive nature of these ancient containers. Sure that there was treasure to be found in the jars, **Yuri** and **Ithior** set about searching as many of the jars as possible. Meanwhile, **Nork**'s examination of the southern door in this revealed a carving reading "R.I.P. Orwyn the Younger," testament to some long-dead adventurer's fate.

## An Unexpected Ally

In the **Offering Bowls** chamber, they encountered **Giuseppe Baldini**, a crotchety middle-aged herbalist seeking treasure. Rather than welcome another treasure-hunter into their ranks, the party wisely encouraged him to leave the citadel entirely—sparing him the horrors to come.

Following the chamber's intended purpose, they made offerings to the ancient bowls, each receiving luck tokens as the old magic recognized their devotion.

## Into the Labyrinth

A maze-like **Labyrinth** tested both their courage and navigation skills. Using the time-honored right-hand rule, **Yuri** led them through the twisting passages while their torchlight revealed ominous cloven hoofprints in the sand—each two handspans wide, a grim reminder of what stalked these halls.

Emerging into the **Bas-Relief Hall**, they discovered **Brell**, a frail and panicky beastman who had collapsed while fleeing some unknown terror. Near his unconscious form, a burlap sack contained two dead rats with snapped necks (a grisly gift for his feared brother **Rogath**).

When **Brell** awakened, he revealed crucial intelligence: the beastmen and ettercaps were at war, and the beastman tribes lived under **Rogath**'s rule. Most importantly, **Rogath** had convinced his beastpeople that the world outside the citadel was overrun with dragons, making it too dangerous to leave—a lie that kept them trapped in their underground existence.

## Death from Above

Their conversation was interrupted by a **cave creeper** scuttling across the ceiling toward their torchbearer. The horse-sized centipede creature struck with lethal efficiency, dropping **Nork** in a single devastating attack. But **Ithior** and **Nork** stood their ground and hurled magic missiles as the party slaughtered the creature before it could claim another victim. **Isolde**'s healing salves restored **Nork** to fighting condition, and they pressed onward.

Using acid salvaged from their time in the Trial of the Slime Lord, **Yuri** melted the lock on the ornate door leading to the **Central Courtyard**—a clever solution to their lack of a skilled thief in the party.

## The Red Devil's Wrath

The **Central Courtyard** stretched before them, bathed in desert sunlight and dominated by a massive black onyx bull statue adorned with humanoid skulls. And there, in all his terrible glory, stood the **Scarlet Minotaur**—nine feet of wine-red fury with his two-headed greataxe **Bloodlust** gleaming in the sun.

The crawlers' diplomatic overtures fell on deaf ears. **Isolde**'s longbow started the battle with an arrow directly to the Minotaur's throat and the party took cover against the beast's devastating charges.

## The Last Stand

What followed was a battle that tested every lesson they'd learned in the depths. The **Scarlet Minotaur** moved into their midst, forcing them to scatter. **Yuri**, ever the brave soul, taunted the creature to draw its attention—a heroic gesture that cost him his life as **Bloodlust** found its mark.

**Ithior** and **Nork** took advantage of the momentary distraction and barraged the Minotaur with magic missiles, but were cut down by the brutal Bloodlust. **Isolde** found herself alone, playing a desperate game of hit-and-run against a nigh-immortal foe while her friends bled out on the ancient stones of the courtyard.

When **Nork** miraculously awakened for one final stand, he found his companions bleeding out at the hooves of the Minotaur. Then he made the ultimate sacrifice; rather than flee, he unleashed **Burning Hands** at point-blank range, hoping to down the **Scarlet Minotaur** and rescue **Yuri** and **Ithior**. However, the Minotaur's answering strike cut him down for the third and final time.

## Pyrrhic Victory

**Isolde** ultimately delivered the killing blow that finally felled the **Scarlet Minotaur**. But victory came at a terrible price—all of her companions lay dead in the courtyard.

Worse still, as she dragged **Nork**'s body toward the exit, an ettercap extorted a fee for safe passage. Wounded and exhausted, **Isolde** lacked both the health and coin to make multiple trips.

## The Cost of Glory

**Isolde** emerged from the Lost Citadel as the sole survivor, bearing **Nork**'s body but leaving behind **Yuri** and **Ithior**—and with them, the legendary **Marasoda, the Sludge Slayer**. The greatest anti-ooze weapon ever forged now lies somewhere in the depths of the citadel, waiting for someone brave enough to retrieve it.

The **Scarlet Minotaur** is dead, his reign of terror ended, but the price of victory was measured in the blood of heroes. **Isolde** alone carries the tale of their triumph and the weight of their sacrifice.

*In the annals of crawler legend, the slaying of the Scarlet Minotaur will be remembered as one of the greatest victories ever achieved. But those who sing the songs will never know the true cost—the friends left behind in the darkness, and the legendary weapon that waits still in the depths for someone worthy to claim it.*
