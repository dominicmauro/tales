After their harrowing escape from Mugdulblub's domain in Bittermold Keep, the party received word of a new crisis: the **Cult of the Crimson Hand** had been raiding local villages, kidnapping several villagers including Father Marcus, a beloved priest of St. Terragnis.

The cultists' trail led south through the grasslands toward their dark temple carved into a hillside.

The morning journey started peacefully enough until the party spotted wild boars in the distance. The party wisely decided to give them a wide berth as they passed by, but as the sun began its descent, a dark shadow rippled across the grassland: not from clouds, but from something circling miles above. Looking up, the party spotted an enormous winged creature gliding in predatory circles, apparently on the hunt.

**Mirena** had a brilliant idea: she shot an arrow at the distant stream where the boars were drinking, startling them. The creature immediately banked and began circling down toward the commotion. While the apex predator was distracted, the party made a run for the nearby forest.

## The Cairn of the Drowned

Deeper in the woods along the Wraithwater Fjord's coast, the party discovered a tall stone cairn wrapped in chains. This was a memorial to sailors lost in the fjord—dozens and dozens of names carved into the stacked stones.

**Clee**, moved by the solemnity of the place, carved the name of a fallen friend into one of the stones. The spirits of the lost sailors blessed him for honoring their memory: advantage on his next attack against undead.

Following crimson cloth scraps caught on branches, **Plum** led the party off the main path through the brush. There, carved into the side of a seaside cliff, stood the dark temple of the Crimson Hand.

Two brown-robed figures stood sentry at the entrance—but they were doing a terrible job. The taller one was berating the shorter one: "It's all your fault! We could have been inside celebrating with the others, and instead we're stuck out here on sentry duty!"

## "We're the Entertainment!"

**Clee** and **Mirena** approached the distracted guards. When challenged about who they were, **Clee** delivered his line with perfect timing: "We're the entertainment! Can't have a proper fell ritual without a bard and a camel!" The guards bought it completely. "They hired a minstrel show?! They hired a bard? This guy's got a camel! We're missing the whole show!" They waved the party inside, arguing more intensely about whose fault it was for missing the performance.

Inside the **Entry Hall** (Area 2), a large skull statue dominated the room, covered in dried bloody handprints. An inscription read: *"The price of entry is blood, and it shall be paid, one way or another."*

Mirena, moving quickly toward the sound of voices from the east, walked right past the statue without touching it. Immediately, she was afflicted with bloodlust—an overwhelming urge to attack the nearest creature.

Through sheer force of will, Mirena restrained herself, bearing her teeth and straining not to attack her companions. The rest of the party quickly caught on: each member cut their palm and smeared bloody handprints on the skull statue before proceeding.

## The Great Hall Massacre

Opening the door at the end of the eastern hallway revealed the Great Hall: nine robed figures (six brown-robed neophytes and three red-robed acolytes) were tormenting two terrified villagers—one of whom the party recognized from the silver locket they'd found in the Lost Citadel of the Scarlet Minotaur sessions ago.

**Clee** didn't miss a beat. He threw the doors open and announced: "You can't have a fell ritual without music!" nd used his *Fascinate* ability, and the entire room began swaying and clapping along to his performance. The cultists were completely entranced, waving their cruel daggers in time with the beat.

Then Clee made it even better: with a charisma check, he led the fascinated villagers in a dance through the crowd of entranced cultists, spinning them past the zealots and out to safety. The cultists parted aside, waving their daggers, completely oblivious as their captives literally danced to freedom.

## The Coup de Grâce

With the villagers safely evacuated and the cultists still fascinated by Clee's performance, **Roke** cast *Sleep*. Every cultist in the room collapsed.

**Mirena**, **Isolde**, and **Clee** then systematically executed the three red-robed acolytes while they slept. They stripped the bodies, donned the red robes, and made a bold proclamation to the awakening brown-robed neophytes:

> "We are your new masters now."

The confused neophytes, seeing some naked bodies and three new red-robed figures, accepted this explanation without question.

## The Dungeon

The party moved north to the Dungeon, where four more villagers huddled in a squalid cell. The bars were rusted and brittle, the door locked.

**Plum** picked the lock with ease (critical success!), and Roke distributed daggers to the freed villagers, arming them for escape. The villagers revealed crucial information: Father Marcus was being tortured in the next room, and other captives had been taken to the ritual chamber.

## The Halls of Pain

**Roke** peeked into the Halls of Pain and witnessed a horrifying scene: a drow woman (the **Mistress of Pain**) stood over Father Marcus, who was strapped to a torture table. Two red-robed acolytes watched gleefully as she worked.

The drow wheeled around when **Roke** entered: "I told you not to disturb me!"

**Roke's** response? Cast *Sleep* again. Everyone in the room—including Father Marcus—collapsed.

While the Mistress of Pain slept, **Isolde**, **Plum**, and **Roke** performed another round of coup de grâce. The cultists were slain, and the Mistress of Pain met her end on her own torture table.

Father Marcus, once freed and healed, was horrified but grateful. The old priest, covered in welts and cuts, coughed up blood but insisted: "There are other villagers! You have to free the others!"

## Equipment Storage

The party looted the equipment storage in the Halls of Pain:
- Chainmail armor
- Mace (Father Marcus's)
- 5 daggers (distributed to freed villagers)
- **Skull Key** (taken from the Mistress of Pain)
- Cracked handheld mirror (8 GP, 1 XP for party)
- 12 gold pieces (1 XP for party)
- Black robe
- Leather armor
- Whip

## The Great Escape Begins

With seven villagers freed, the party prepared to evacuate them from the temple. Kara and Igram helped the injured Father Marcus limp toward the exit, while the others followed with daggers in trembling hands.

But deeper in the temple, past the locked door to the east, the party's wraith scout reported ominous news: four villagers were bound to stakes in the Ritual Chamber, where a black-robed leader and four red-robed acolytes were chanting. A river of caustic blood flowed around the perimeter.

The final confrontation awaited.
