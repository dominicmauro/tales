Four crawlers: **Isolde** (Dwarf Ranger), **Clee Parr** (Human Bard), **Roke Ritchie** (Goblin Wizard), and **Mirena** (Human Desert Rider) remain deep in the Hideous Halls of Mugdulblub, caught between an elder god, its fanatical Bittermold worshippers, and a gelatinous cube. They had only one option: run north into unexplored territory and pray they could find a way out.

The session began where we left off last; a strange chamber where a carpet of tiny glossy brown mushrooms covered the floor. More ominously, the northeastern wall churned and frothed with bubbles, hissing and popping like a boiling cauldron—the dissolution accelerating before their eyes.

With angry Bittermolds pounding on the door to the south and the gelatinous cube blocking the way forward to the east, **Clee** opened the door north. His torch revealed a room with four alcoves and thin rectangular objects on the walls, and to the north, natural cave formations with dozens of holes in the ceiling creating an eerie, tooth-rattling hum as air whistled through them.

## The Tarnished Gold Frames

**Mirena** examined the rectangular objects—tarnished gold frame paintings, though the paint had melted into gray slurry dribbling down the walls. Ever practical, she grabbed the frame. Worth 10 gold pieces!

Behind one of the frames, **Clee** discovered something crucial: an old parchment scrap that read: **"The door is behind my statue. —R.B."**

## Isolde's Brilliant Defense

As the party looted the remaining three paintings (40 GP total—enough for a proper carouse!), **Isolde** had a stroke of tactical genius: she jammed her crowbar into the southern door, barricading it shut.

This bought precious time. **Clee's** summoned wraiths held the other chokepoint, systematically dismantling Bittermolds who tried to break through. Mugdulblub itself slaughtered one of the wraiths, but the party's delaying tactics were working.

## Tarbats and Burning Hands

Moving into the northern caverns, **Mirena's** torch illuminated the ceiling—and disturbed a colony of tarbats: horrible, sticky, sulfurous bats that swarmed toward heat sources.

**Clee** immediately used his bardic *Fascinate* ability, transfixing the bats with enchanting bat music. The creatures fluttered in lazy, peaceful circles, entranced by the performance.

Then **Roke Ritchie** asked the fateful question: "If I cast *Burning Hands* on the bats, do we think they'll just become flaming flying kamikaze bats?"

**Roke** cast the spell successfully, hitting four tarbats with a circle of flame. But these weren't ordinary bats—they were immune to fire damage. Instead of dying, they *ignited*, becoming frenzied burning projectiles! The flaming tarbats immediately attacked Roke, and one connected, the bonus fire damage knocking him out instantly.

## The Steam Stalagmites

While Roke lay smoldering on the ground, the party pressed forward into a chamber filled with steaming stalagmites that clacked and rattled like tea kettles. Inside the bowl-like tips of these geological formations were **cave pearls**: round balls of minerals worth investigating.

The party carefully collected five cave pearls total:
- **Mirena** grabbed two successfully
- **Clee** grabbed one, nearly getting scalded by a sudden steam jet
- **Roke** grabbed one after being healed by Isolde
- **Isolde** grabbed the final one

Meanwhile, **Isolde's** herbalism healing brought **Roke** back from unconsciousness with 4 HP restored—a clutch moment that saved the wizard's life.

## Another Acid Quicksand Trap

**Roke**, scouting ahead into the caverns, noticed something familiar about the floor: it was unnaturally smooth in a ten-foot square. *Another acid quicksand trap!* **Roke** avoided the worst of the trap and warned the others. The party marked it and moved on—no time to linger with Bittermolds still in pursuit.

The party completed their circuit through the Hideous Halls, arriving at the Howler camp, where the enormous double doors were barricaded from the far side. **Clee** sent his wraith through the wall, startling the Howlers camped inside. When the explained they'd killed about 20 Bittermolds, the Howlers were impressed and wisely decided not to press for details.

## The Diabolic Screed

While negotiations continued, **Roke** noticed the six pillars in the Howlers camp inscribed with tiny diabolic text. The pillars contained a lengthy legal dispute between a Bittermold ancestor and a demon prince—complete with:
- Parties to the dispute
- The blood-oath boundaries of the Nine Circles
- Obligations of both parties
- And some arcane In*damn*ification clause

As **Roke** read, a faint smell of brimstone began rising in the room. By the time he reached the fourth pillar, even the Howlers noticed: "You should probably stop reading that. That smells scary. Like we ate bad halfling."

The smell grew stronger with each pillar read, and **Roke** stopped before reaching the final two. Whatever summoning ritual or curse was encoded in that diabolic contract, it seemed unwise to complete it.

## Reginald's Secret

The party returned to the Entry Hall and found the melted, waxy statue of Sir Reginald Bittermold with its worn copper plaque. **Mirena** examined it closely and noticed something odd: the plaque was particularly worn and tarnished, despite the lack of traffic in this abandoned keep.

Following the note's instructions, she touched the plaque and the secret door slid open behind the statue, revealing soggy stairs descending 40 feet into wet earth. **Clee**'s wraith scouted ahead and found a small cave where several slimy four-legged catfish stumped in a rhythmic circle around a low rock; a new route into the bowels of the dungeon!

## Escape to Halcyon Keep

Low on torches and resources, the party wisely decided to head home while they were ahead. They'd killed approximately 20 Bittermolds, discovered a secret passage, and survived an encounter with an elder god. That was enough for one (technically two) sessions!

Back at Halcyon Keep, they sold their four tarnished gold frames and pooled 30 GP for a proper carouse.

## The Carouse

With **Clee** the bard leading the revelry, everyone rolled 1d8+1d6:

**Roke (rolled 9):** By talent or trickery, beat a rival crawler in a test of skill. *+5 XP*

**Mirena (rolled 10):** An angry wizard cast a deadly spell at you, but you were so drunk you reflected it off your cup, bouncing it harmlessly into the sky! *+5 XP and start next session with 2 luck tokens!*

**Isolde (rolled 9):** By talent or trickery, beat a rival crawler in a test of skill. *+5 XP*

**Clee (rolled 10):** An angry wizard cast a deadly spell at you, but you were so drunk you reflected it off your cup! *+5 XP and start next session with 2 luck tokens!*

The party celebrated their survival in style. Everyone gained significant experience, and two members would start next session with extra luck—perfect for the dangers ahead.
