## Regions…

- **Wraithwater Fjord**: A haunting body of dark water where no fish swim and no birds call. Local fishermen avoid it, whispering of shapes that move beneath the surface on moonless nights. The water itself appears black as pitch, reflecting neither stars nor moon. Strange currents flow in patterns that make no sense, and sometimes objects thrown into the water simply vanish without a splash. The few who've sailed its waters report hearing voices calling from the depths.
- **The Thornwood**: Dense forest of twisted trees and thorny undergrowth where daylight barely penetrates the canopy. Somewhere within its depths lies the Lost Citadel of the Scarlet Minotaur, abandoned for over a century. The trees themselves seem malevolent, their branches reaching out to snag travelers and their roots shifting to trip the unwary. Those who enter report finding carved stone markers in an unknown script, leading deeper into the forest's heart.
- **Ironspire Peaks**: Jagged mountains piercing the southern sky like the spine of some primordial beast. A recent earthquake has revealed the long-sealed Tomb of the Serpent Kings. The mountains echo with war-drums as goblin tribes clash over territory and ancient treasures. Each tribe bears different markings—bone-white paint, crimson tattoos, or ritual scarification—and they know secret paths through the treacherous peaks. Travelers might broker safe passage with one tribe, only to face the blades of their enemies higher up.
- **Witchstone Highlands**: Rolling hills of purple stone and strange mists that shift color with the phases of the moon. The Ruins of Bittermold Keep crown the highest hill, its broken towers visible for miles like grasping fingers. The witchstone itself is said to hold magical properties, growing warm to the touch near sources of arcane power. Local shepherds report that their flocks refuse to graze certain areas, and that compasses spin wildly when crossing the highlands. At dawn and dusk, the ruins cast shadows that don't match their actual shape.
- **The Blackmire**: A treacherous swampland where solid ground is scarce and the air hangs thick with the weight of ancient sorrow. Deep within lies the Bottomless Tombs, a pit that has swallowed countless explorers and their screams. On foggy nights, the ghostly sounds of battle echo across the water—clashing steel, dying horses, and the cries of fallen warriors. Spectral lights dance between the dead trees, leading travelers astray or sometimes warning them of quicksand and other dangers. The spirits here are restless, some seeking to complete their final battle, others simply hungry for the warmth of living flesh.

## Dungeons explored…

### Lost Citadel of the Scarlet Minotaur

- **Danger Level**: Risky
- **Last Visited**: Session [5](/posts/session-005/)
- **Status**: Partially Cleared
- **Notable Features**: Bronze bull statues, animated armor traps
- **Treasures Found**: Fist-sized emerald and three pearl diadems of ancient kings
- **Description**: An ancient citadel of bull-worshipping warriors in an arid scrubland, now a dark maze of vaulted chambers and crumbling halls. Long ago, these warriors' cultish rituals culminated in their leader Minoros transforming into the immortal Scarlet Minotaur, who slaughtered his own warriors in a single night of mayhem. The citadel itself is home to long-forgotten treasures, but man-sized spiders and  bipedal bulls haunt its shadows while the blood-drenched minotaur stalks the labyrinthine halls.
- **Potential Rewards**: Ancient magical weapons long-considered lost, piles of forgotten gems and gold, scrolls and magical items, diadems with pearls, and various treasures from fallen adventurers and warrior-mages.
- **Warnings**: A savage beast drenched in blood patrols the citadel's halls. Those who die within the walls of the citadel may yet rise as undead to defend its treasures from looters. The citadel is rife with magical traps and territorial monsters.

### Tomb of the Serpent Kings

- **Danger Level**: Unsafe
- **Last Visited**: Session [4](/posts/session-004/)

- **Treasures Found**: Silver Icon of a Scowling Snake-folk King
- **Description**: A buried ruin of the snake-folk who once ruled these lands from their stone halls, partially uncovered by a recent landslide. Rival crawlers think this may be yet another false tomb built to fool grave robbers, but somewhere in the valley lies the true sepulcher where the serpent lords were entombed with their greatest treasures.
- **Potential Rewards**: Ancient gold and jewels, snake-carved artifacts, possibly magical rings and weapons from a lost civilization.
- **Warnings**: “Beware the sleepers in the stone,” the old maps warn. Legends speak of undead guardians, cunning traps, and creatures that turn men to stone with but a glance.

## Dungeons Rumored…

### The Ruins Below Bittermold Keep

- **Source**: Local woodcutters recently spotted several short, cloaked figures scurrying into the keep. One followed the figures into the ruins, but was never seen again.
- **Description**: The ruins of Bittermold Keep sit atop a hill, its stones slowly melting into the earth from some horrible curse. The wealthy Bittermold family once lived there, but their line suddenly died out and the whole place fell into ruin. Woodsmen recently spotted several short, cloaked figures scurrying into the keep, and hunters have heard ululating cries echoing from within the ruins.
- **Potential Rewards**: The lord of Bittermold Keep was said to possess a magic ruby that let him walk through fire unscathed - a gift from a demon. Ancient family treasures, mysterious meteorite fragments, and various magical trinkets are rumored to lie within the dissolving halls.
- **Warnings**: This curse also causes strange things to seep from the walls. Strange creatures are said to inhabit catacombs beneath the ruins, warring amongst themselves. Fishermen report catching four-legged catfish in nearby streams, and the very architecture seems to be liquefying from some primordial influence lurking beneath.
