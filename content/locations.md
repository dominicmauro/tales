## Rumored…

### Lost Citadel of the Scarlet Minotaur

- **Source**: Muggins Greenbottle, renowned tomb robber - "The Red Death will find you, one way or another."
- **Description**: An ancient citadel of bull-worshipping warriors in an arid scrubland, now a dark maze of vaulted chambers and crumbling halls. Long ago, these warriors' cultish rituals culminated in their leader Minoros transforming into the immortal Scarlet Minotaur, who slaughtered his own warriors in a single night of mayhem. The citadel itself is home to long-forgotten treasures, but man-sized spiders and  bipedal bulls haunt its shadows while the blood-drenched minotaur stalks the labyrinthine halls.
- **Potential Rewards**: Ancient magical weapons long-considered lost, piles of forgotten gems and gold, scrolls and magical items, diadems with pearls, and various treasures from fallen adventurers and warrior-mages.
- **Warnings**: A savage beast drenched in blood patrols the citadel's halls. Those who die within the walls of the citadel may yet rise as undead to defend its treasures from looters. The citadel is rife with magical traps and territorial monsters.

### Tomb of the Serpent Kings

- **Source**: Old Gareth the Map Seller
- **Description**: A buried ruin of the snake-folk who once ruled these lands from their stone halls, partially uncovered by a recent landslide. Rival crawlers think this may be yet another false tomb built to fool grave robbers, but somewhere in the valley lies the true sepulcher where the serpent lords were entombed with their greatest treasures.
- **Potential Rewards**: Ancient gold and jewels, snake-carved artifacts, possibly magical rings and weapons from a lost civilization.
- **Warnings**: “Beware the sleepers in the stone,” the old maps warn. Legends speak of undead guardians, cunning traps, and creatures that turn men to stone with but a glance.

### The Ruins Below Bittermold Keep

- **Source**: Local woodcutters recently spotted several short, cloaked figures scurrying into the keep. One followed the figures into the ruins, but was never seen again.
- **Description**: The ruins of Bittermold Keep sit atop a hill, its stones slowly melting into the earth from some horrible curse. The wealthy Bittermold family once lived there, but their line suddenly died out and the whole place fell into ruin. Woodsmen recently spotted several short, cloaked figures scurrying into the keep, and hunters have heard ululating cries echoing from within the ruins.
- **Potential Rewards**: The lord of Bittermold Keep was said to possess a magic ruby that let him walk through fire unscathed - a gift from a demon. Ancient family treasures, mysterious meteorite fragments, and various magical trinkets are rumored to lie within the dissolving halls.
- **Warnings**: This curse also causes strange things to seep from the walls. Strange creatures are said to inhabit catacombs beneath the ruins, warring amongst themselves. Fishermen report catching four-legged catfish in nearby streams, and the very architecture seems to be liquefying from some primordial influence lurking beneath.
